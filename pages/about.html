                <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Maayan.</p>
                <p>Before I write down the obvious that design is part of <br> my life here are some facts about me:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="thing-i-love">
                    <p class="libre-baskerville-italic">I like to laugh and have fun.</p>
                    <p class="libre-baskerville-italic">I love to travel around the world and I've been on <br> three
                        continents.</p>
                    <p class="libre-baskerville-italic">I love learning new things.</p>
                    <p class="libre-baskerville-italic">I love fashion design and I know to sew.</p>
                    <p class="libre-baskerville-italic">I'm mad about dogs!</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So now that you to know a bit about me I can continue <br> to tell that I graduated four years
                    on Avni Institute of <br> Art and Design in Tel Aviv, studying visual <br> communication,
                    my love of design touches every <br> aspect of my life.
                </p>
                <p>My design style is rich and I cannot define it.</p>
                <p>
                    I believe that graphic design has changed the world <br> and will continue to do so in conveying
                    messages in a <br>
                    beautiful and correct way and today in the digital age <br> we are developing and can have a greater
                    impact on <br>
                    the daily experience and influence it by making it <br> more useful, beautiful and accessible.
